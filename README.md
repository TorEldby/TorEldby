Hello. My name is Tor Eldby. I am a norwegian developer from the northern city of Narvik. 
I have a M.Sc. of applied computer science. My first job after finishing my studies was at Datarespons R&D services, a consultancy firm, in Kongsberg.
My first project was related to using the Yocto Project for creating Linux-based operating systems for an in-house embedded system based on the NVIDIA Tegra microprocessor.
Afterwards, I was contracted to work for Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace - Division Land Systems on their RWS project.
Currently, I've gone back to the university I studied at, now as a employee. I am hired as a scientific assistant as I wait for the possibility to start their
PhD programme. In the mean time I teach the faculty's C++ course and will work on a new master's thesis in hopes to improve my chances for a PhD.

I have a variety of interests and fascinations, mathematics chief among them. Other interests are things like physics and chemistry. Aside from purely
scientific interests, I have a variety of interests in the computer science world. 3D, simulations, visualization, AI, algorithms, datastructures, programming theory, Linux, Obsidian, and 3D printing make up a small subset.
I am by no means an expert in any of those fields yet, but I believe that having a fascination and interest in something is the first step towards devoting the time and effort needed to create great things.

Other hobbies include working out, making good food, playing videogames with my friends, woodworking, carpentry, etc.

I intend to have many projects set up properly as I begin to explore my interests further.

Currently, you can contact me here on Github, and you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tor-eldby-137820155/)
